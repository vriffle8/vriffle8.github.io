									<p>Abstract: Unlike most crop industries, there is a strongly held belief within the wine industry that increased vine age correlates with quality. Considering this perception could be explained by vine physiological differences, the purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of vine age on phenology and gas exchange parameters. An interplanted, dry farmed, Zinfandel vineyard block under consistent management practices in the Central Coast of California was evaluated over two consecutive growing seasons. Treatments included Young vines (5 to 12 years old), Control (representative proportion of young to old vines in the block), and Old vines (40 to 60 years old). Phenology, leaf water potential, and gas exchange parameters were tracked. Results indicated a difference in phenological progression after berry set between Young and Old vines. Young vines progressed more slowly during berry formation and more rapidly during berry ripening, resulting in Young vines being harvested before Old vines due to variation in the timing of sugar accumulation. No differences in leaf water potential were found. Young vines had higher mid-day stomatal conductance and tended to have higher mid-day photosynthetic rates. The results of this study suggest vine age is a factor in phenological timing and growing season length.</p>

									<p>Abstract: A two-year study was conducted at a commercial vineyard in California’s Templeton Gap AVA to evaluate the effect of vine age on viticultural, enological, and sensory attributes of Vitis vinifera L. cv. Zinfandel grapes and wines. The experimental block was dry farmed, conventionally managed, with own-rooted Zinfandel vines that, when determined unproductive, were replaced with new vines of genetically identical scion plant material grafted onto St. George (Vitis rupestris Scheele) rootstock. Treatments included Young vines (5 to 12 years old), Control (representative proportion of young to old vines in the block), and Old vines (40 to 60 years old). Results indicated Young vines progressed more slowly during berry formation and more rapidly during berry ripening than Old vines. Due to variation in the timing of sugar accumulation, Old vines were harvested 21 days after Young vines in 2019, and 9 days after in 2020. Old vines produced, on average between both seasons, 3.7 kg more fruit per vine than Young vines. Old vines also produced, on average between both seasons, 22.8 more clusters per vine than Young vines (5.41 tons/acre and 2.64 tons/acre, respectively). The larger vine capacity observed was attributed to Old vines having more arm, spur and dormant bud positions per vine than Young vines, in addition to larger trunk circumference and diameter. Vine age also had an effect on vine vegetative growth, with Old vines producing shorter internodes (25.5% decrease) and smaller shoot diameters (29.3% decrease) compared to Young vines. Young vines had higher mid-day stomatal conductance and tended to have higher mid-day photosynthetic rates, although no differences in corresponding pre-dawn measurements were found. While root architecture was similar between age groups, Old vines displayed greater rooting depths. Young vine wines had lower pH and titratable acidity than Old vine wines. Old vine wines were defined by a wider array and intensity of aromatics, including raisin, orange peel, black fruit and spices relative to Young vine wines which were defined by wet topsoil and pomegranate aromas. These results suggest the potential for greater yield and improved wine quality when extending the longevity of Zinfandel vineyards.</p>

									<p>Abstract: “Old” vines are highly sought after by wine industry professionals and consumers due to their rarity and perceived superior wine quality. To evaluate the validity of this assertion, a two-year study was conducted at a single, interplanted Zinfandel vineyard block in California’s Paso Robles AVA. Treatments included Young vines (five to 12 years old), Control (a representative proportion of young to old vines in the block), and Old vines (40 to 60 years old). Vine age had an effect on vine vegetative growth, with Old vines producing shorter internodes (25.5% decrease) and smaller shoot diameters (29.3% decrease) than Young vines. No differences were found in photo- synthetically active radiation or leaf area index between Old and Young vines. Old vines developed more quickly during berry formation and more slowly during berry ripening periods. Due to variation in the timing of sugar accumulation, Old vines were harvested 21 days after Young vines in 2019 and nine days after in 2020. Vine age affected yield, with Old vines producing, on average between both seasons, 3.7 kg more fruit per vine than Young vines. Old vines also produced, on average between both seasons, 22.8 more clusters per vine than Young vines (5.41 tons/acre and 2.64 tons/acre, respectively). Larger vine capacity is attributed to Old vines having more arm, spur, and dormant bud positions per vine than Young vines. Additionally, Old vines had larger trunk circumferences and diameters than Young vines. Old vine fruit had higher Brix, pH, and titratable acidity than Young vines at harvest in 2019 only, with no differences found in 2020. No differences in berry color or phenolics were found between Old and Young vines. These results suggest the potential for greater yield and increased growing season length when extending the longevity of Zinfandel vineyards.</p>
